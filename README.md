I am **Gabriel Ong**, a Year 4 Computer Science major at the National University of Singapore. I'm strongly passionate about leveraging on modern technologies for problem solving and developing scalable and forward-looking solutions! :wrench:

My interests are currently in Full stack development and Cloud computing and architecture.

I enjoy listening to all kinds of music, making coffee and playing old video games in my free time! :coffee::space_invader:
