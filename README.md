I am **Gabriel Ong**, a software engineer based in Singapore. I'm strongly passionate about leveraging on modern technologies for problem solving and developing scalable and forward-looking solutions! :wrench:

My interests are currently in Full Stack Development and Cloud Computing.

I enjoy listening to all kinds of music, making coffee and playing old video games in my free time! :coffee::space_invader:
